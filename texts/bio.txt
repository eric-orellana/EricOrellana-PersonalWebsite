Hi! My name is Eric Orellana. Thank you for checking out my website - Welcome!

I am a curious guy who is doing his best! Doing his best at what though? Well, a bunch of fun things really.

I enjoy learning new topics, building stuff, and overcoming challenges. Whether it's building a website, recording and editing Youtube videos, completing video games, running, or music.

The purpose of this website is to share anything I found interesting. I will be sharing different projects of mine below. I am happy to chat about any of them! Feel free to email me at ericorellana42@gmail.com. Thanks again!
