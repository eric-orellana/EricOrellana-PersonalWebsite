Hi! My name is Eric Orellana. Thank you for checking out my website - Welcome!

I have always been described as curious. This website is where I investigate and share my creations with you. I enjoy learning new topics, building stuff, and overcoming challenges. Whether it's building a website, recording and editing Youtube videos, completing video games, running, or music.

Check out my varying projects below. I am happy to chat about any of them! Feel free to email me at ericorellana42@gmail.com. Thanks again!
